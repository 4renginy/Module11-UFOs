Putting this to a regular web page will make it hard for the viewers to find the right data instead she decided to use javascript and html together to create interactive dashboard for the site visiters. 

She already knows using html and css she can create only flat web pages but she wants to have an interactive dashboard with filtering options. In order to do that she decided to add javascript to the picture. Javascript is a front end devepomnet language which means extra funcionality and enhancing  the user experiance.
Javascript has several futures specifically useful for data anlysis like creating dashboards, buttons, dropdown-boxes...by adding javascript we are creating a "dynamic web page"

## The idea
So the idea is to create a interactive web page using [javascript_code](https://github.com/4renginy/Module11-UFOs/blob/main/Static/js/app.js), [html_index_file](https://github.com/4renginy/Module11-UFOs/blob/main/index.html) and [css_style](https://github.com/4renginy/Module11-UFOs/blob/main/Static/css/style.css) together. 
<br>In that page, she will have a big table with all the information in it, next to the table she will include filters to pull out specific data. 

## Result
After finishing the dashboard she added some fun touches to the page to make it more interesting and visually attractive. She is very happy the way it turned out and she hopes the visitors will enjoy her page as much as she enjoyed creating it.
